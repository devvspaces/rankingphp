I would add a Search Bar that to the top of the admin list and the public list that indexes the times on the list
I would also Make a clickable link for each person on the list that takes you to a page showing a bigger picture of that person and a box below it where I can edit and add their details for the public to see.
A small text below the name of the person on the list that shows the Highest and lowest ranking of all time for that particular listed person automatically

##Bug fixes 
* Clicking edit or delete does not do anything (except delete on desktop, which works but will cause the admin mode to exit) 
* I will Fix bug that causes admin mode to exit to the regular user mode when clicking “delete” on desktop. NOTE: clicking edit or delete does nothing on mobile.
* Make desktop version fit the screen better
